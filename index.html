        <h1 id = "title">Hi! My name is Japleen Kaur.</h1>
        <p id = "para"> I am a senior at Evergreen Valley High School, located in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. I have a passion for growing my knowledge in the field of Computer Science. I love exploring its applications with other fields like Music and Health, making applications independently and at programs like COSMOS in the Music and Technology cluster and MIT Beaver Works in the Autonomous Cognitive Assistant group. I am also part of my schoolâ€™s Computer Science Pathway Academy.</p>
        <p>At school, I am on the officer team for the Programming and Computer Science Honors Society clubs, promoting diversity and boosting the number of female members. I also coach the Public Forum team at my school as captain.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include creating new Spotify playlists, debating (qualified to the 2022 Tournament of Champions for Varsity Public Forum), field hockey/running, and crocheting.</p>
